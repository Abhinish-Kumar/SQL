## History and Story of Data.


#### What is Data?
Before storing the data in database you must have a knowledge about data. what is this?
Database:-"its a collection of data,a method for accessing and manipulating that data".....data is everywhere company is big like amazone alibaba because of their data.Every thing work with a data from a simple drawn to a robot.We produce 2.5 quantrilians of data every year.
From where all these data come from data is the thing that as human us created but without capturing and using that data it is useless for us.Like only listening and gathering information from teacher and from online courses is usesless after some time for you to make it useful you have to make a proper notes.Databases work same as our notes they capture the data so that we can use it there are 44zetabytes of data are there we have now.All these data is captured in database.
You can not tore that much of huge data without database.Without database all the companies like instagram and facebook does not make money.Databases are not special things they are just hardware and software they are just computers.Here hardware is the mechanical part and software is the actual code that collects the useful data its here software is like a inteligent person in a store and we are the person who give him data to put somewhere by own self in the drawer and here the store or a godown is a database.
It is like a disk drive to store once and zeroes.We can create database in our phone and in our computer because the real database is same as our computer with different software and a large memory size.


1. We are now clear with that database is a hardware with a database software at top of it.
2. Excell is also a database to store our data and excel is a database software that allows us to manipulate our data a pen and a paper is also a database because its also a way to store our data.
3. The images of our database is like a circular disks putting one into another is because of this drummemory heck its image in stackoverflow.
4. Before disk drive we store our data in drum memory which is cylendrical in shape.
5. Because of its historical reason we have a cylendrical shape for database.
6. As we know that database is a software and harware there are many types of databases.
7. Excel is also a database so why we not use it for big company why we have other database.
8. Because in database we store a huge amount of data that we can not hande with Excel and spreadsheet.
9. Like integrity in database so that not every body can delete our database.
10. You can store terabytes of data.
11. You can combine different databases.
12. You can write programs to do so many interesting things with your data.
13. These things you can not do in spreadsheet.


#### These are some most popular databases.
1. MariaDB.
2. MS-SQL Server.
3. MOngoDB.
4. ElasticSearch.
5. Redis.
6. SQLite.
7. PostgreSQL.
8. IBM DB2.
9. Oracle Database.
10. Cassandra.


#### How companies use the data.
1. Product manager knowser about their product at which they are working on.They learn from the data that their product is working properly or not.Know about the drawbacks of their products and improve it to make sales.Used to target the perfect users for their products.
2. Like a web and a app developer who developed a app you put a sign in and a login page to stre the information about the user so that you can get the same user on your website by their data by shareing the link of your new product to them by their contact information that increses the chances of your sales.
3. They can play the game with their last saved location.
4. There are a data engineer and a data scientist in your company that makes decision on the behalf of the company data that creates a better macine learnign algorithms that give a better information to the users.
5. We have database administrators and databse engineers who install the database software and maintain the database they install database and update software of database.They use hadoop amazone redchip etc.

#### We can learn that.
1. How to put data in DB.
2. How to use/update/learn from data.
3. How to remove data.

#### What is thissssssssssss....
1. Datbase Management system.
2. Relational database management system.
3. Structured Query language.

##### DBMS is a software and a program to manage database it recieves information somebody like us that wants something with data and instruct the system the data base to grab that data and make chages to that data.

##### Relational Database management system is a subset of dbms it is a most used most popular type of database.It is used to setup relation among different data records.

##### SQL is language to communicate with databases or dbms and rdbms.

Example:like thik that we have a data so we have to use RDBMS(postgreSQL) that gives some functions to create databse and manage database.Both DATA + DBMS is combines to make a database.And at last finally we have sql (structured query language) outside our database its not a programming language its a query language.It gives powser like developer to communicate with that databse.Its like a simple english language.

Listen by using sql it doesnt mean that we are here to manage only a single type of database like posrgreSQL.By learnig SQL we can interact eith lots of databases like MAriaDB,SQL server,MySQL,oracleDB,SQLite,PostgreSQL.

## Types of Databases
There are hundreds of databases are there but you have to know about only few of them.
Databases are mainly divided into five categories.

1. Relational model.(Postgrace).
2. Document model.(mongoDB,caugh,Firebase they use document model)
3. Key value databases(Radis,dynamodb,all have key value storage system).
4. Graph model databases.(comples and rarely use)
5. Wide columinar(new and allpy googles big table,apachi,casendra)

#### A database is a system of hardware and software that allow a user to store and organize and use data.
